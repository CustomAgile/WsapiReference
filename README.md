## Wsapi Reference

This app is a great tool to help users utilize wsapi object model data.  The user can select their workspace and object model to populate the query, attributes, and misc panels.  

The query panel enables the user to test queries by submitting the form.  The attributes panel builds a tree of the object model's attributes.  The misc panel is a grid that contains extra information about the object model such as parent and note if they exist.
